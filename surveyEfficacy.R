#This function will do mutiple things:
#1. Plot random number of sites in an area.
#2. Plot random number of articfacts within each ellipsis.
#3. Superimpose grids of survey pits to test how many pits hit sites and articacts.

surveyEfficacy<-function(area,SiteArea,SiteDensity){
  #Variable propoerties:
  ##Area: vectors with horizontal and vertical size of area surveyed.
  ##SiteArea: it will one of two: either vector with 4 values: min, max, mean (or median), and standard deviation. 
    #Or one single value for uniform sites.  
    #Sites will all be ellipses with radii not too different and random angles.
    #sites will not overlap by much, for now.
  ##SiteDensity: can be either one value or a vector with 2 values (min and max) to create a range of densities.
